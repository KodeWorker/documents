# Virtual Metrology Related Paper Survey #.1

## A Processing Quality Prognostics Scheme for Plasma Sputtering in TFT-LCD Manufacturing
=========================================================================================
by Y.C. Su, M.H. Hung, F.T. Cheng and Y.T. Chen, IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing, May 2006 

### Features: 

[1] mainly related to vacuum, insert gas concentration, power

[2] 10s sampling period and 6 samples of sensor data correspond to one product

### Model Structure:

[1] QPS = Conjecture Model + Prediction Model

[2] Conjecture Model dynamically increases the complexity of the model (self-learning) and evaluates the error for termination conditions

[3] WMA(Weighted Moving Average -> prediction model) only adopts two previous-lot actual measurements and one current-lot conjecture value from conjecture model 

## Adaptive Virtual Metrology Applied to a CVD Process
======================================================
by K. Olson and J. Moyne, Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference (ASMC), 2010

### Notes

[1] process for developing a VM solution: data collection -> model development -> model adaptation and application

[2] PLS(Partial Least Squares) can be thought of roughly as the demension of variablility in the input space that have the most significant impact on dimensions of variability in the output space.

[3] 1) complexities of model maintenance make the use of trace data on a run-to-run basis impractical 2) reduced data from FD(fault detection) models is sufficient to support  high quality prediction models

### Features:

[1] including product and maintenance information, process recipe data, and the thickness metrology data

[2] the initial FD data was primarily mean and std summart info of trace data

[3] Cross-chamber adaptation: by examining the commonality of variable contributors to the PLS models
- Heater Temperature
- Heater Output Power
- Pressure 1
- Pressure 2
- Pin Lift Position
- Gas Flow Rate

### Model Development

[1] separate base model were developed for each chamber (all model were verified to have the same contributors)

[2] Moving Window PLS adaptation: contains DOE or Historical data(is kept in model all times), discard old data and retain some old, add data beteen metrology runs(VM), and the actual metrology data. All the features in the window will be weighted.

### Lession Learned

[1] Handle missing and outlier FD data

[2] It's better develop individual models for each chamber rather than a comprehensive model across all chambers

[3] Model adaptation is a critical requirement of the models because the processes tend to drift or shift over time

## Virtual Metrology Modeling for CVD film Thickness
====================================================
by J. Besnard, D. Gleispach, H. Gris, A. Ferreira, A. Roussy, C. Kernaflen and G. Hayderer, International Journal of Control Science and Engineering, 2012

### Notes

[1] Reliable and accurate FDC(Fault Detection and Classification) data are essential in VM model.

[2] Authors strongly believe that the maintenance of may single models is not compatible with the constraints of the industry.

[3] In this paper, VM saves the cost of the metrology after USG(Undoped Silicon Glass), before CMP(Chemical Mechanical Polishing)

### Features:

[1] The relavent process parameters that characterize the CVD process, such as gas flow, pressure, temperature, plasma parameters ...etc.

[2] Summarize the temporal data into a FDC indicator(mean, range, max., min., slope, etc.)

[3] R&R is studied to assure the quality and effectiveness of VM models.

### Conclusions

[1] This paper compares two different type of mathematical modeling(PLS and Tree Ensenbles). However, different algorithms yeild similar results in terms of prediction capability. (Modeling contributes low part in VM case)

[2] Two main challenges: Robustness of model over time (model update approach) & Trusted Predictions (develop  an indicator of confidence).
